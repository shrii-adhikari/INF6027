# Analysis of Headlines and Short Descriptions in News Articles

## Introduction
This project analyses the linguistic and semantic relationship between headlines and their corresponding short descriptions in news articles. It explores the use of promotional headlines, their impact on content quality, and their association with specific authors. The study also identifies key patterns and trends in the dataset using clustering and sentiment analysis techniques.

## Research Questions
1. **What are the common linguistic and semantic features between headlines and their corresponding short descriptions?**  
   - Headlines exhibit more emotionally charged language, while short descriptions are neutral and factual. The semantic similarity between them is low, reflecting a deliberate difference in tone and intent.

2. **Is there a significant relationship between specific authors and the use of promotional headlines?**  
   - Certain authors consistently use promotional headlines, with some contributing up to 35-45% of clickbait articles. This highlights an editorial or stylistic preference for sensationalism to attract engagement.

3. **How does the use of promotional headlines affect the overall content quality or accuracy?**  
   - Sensationalist headlines often create a gap between expectations and the content's actual tone, potentially undermining credibility and trust in the articles.

## Key Findings
1. **Sentiment Mismatch**: Headlines tend to be predominantly negative, while short descriptions are often positive.  
2. **Clickbait Prevalence**: Of 12,051 articles from the top 10 contributors, 4,376 were flagged as clickbait. For four authors, clickbait articles made up 40-50% of their total contributions.  
3. **Clustering Analysis**: Semantic similarity analysis revealed four distinct clusters:  
   - High similarity in meaning  
   - Moderate similarity  
   - Low similarity  
   - Minimal semantic or keyword overlap
